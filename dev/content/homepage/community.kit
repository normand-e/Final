            <p>Our hope is that Vault + Vine becomes for each person who walks through the door what it has become for us:</p>
            <p>An urban oasis in the East Falls neighborhood of Philadelphia; an atmosphere of abundance and respite; a space for beauty, whimsy, and rejuvenation.</p>
        
            <p>At the heart of our shop is love for our community and a desire to create, promote, and connect with our neighbors. Our vision is to create a community of businesses and customers that supports, promotes, and celebrates the local and global economy and by demanding accountability in every aspect of the supply chain.</p>
